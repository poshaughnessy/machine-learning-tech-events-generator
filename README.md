# Machine Learning generated tech events

I thought I'd try out `textgenrnn` with tech event names. (I also tried it out for [Pavement lyrics](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/machine-learning-lyrics-generator) and [Samsung Internet blog posts](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/machine-learning-blog-posts-generator)).

## Instructions

```
pip3 install textgenrnn
pip3 install tensorflow
python3 run.py
```

## Example output

Here are some of the new event names that it's generated ðŸ˜†

## Credits

Uses [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) which uses [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
